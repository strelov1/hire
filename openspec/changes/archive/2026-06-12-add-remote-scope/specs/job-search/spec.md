## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Searchable jobs index

The system SHALL maintain a Meilisearch index of jobs with one document per job,
keyed by the job's internal `id`. Each document SHALL carry the fields needed to
both match and render a result without a follow-up database read: the searchable
text (title, company, description, location), the filterable facets, the
sortable fields, and the display fields returned to clients.

The index SHALL declare:
- **searchable attributes**: title, company, description, location.
- **filterable attributes**: source, company_slug, work_mode, employment_type,
  seniority, category, domains, regions, countries, company_type, company_size,
  visa_sponsorship, salary_currency, salary_period, skills, salary_min,
  salary_max, experience_years_min. The raw `remote` flag SHALL NOT be a
  filterable attribute (work_mode subsumes it).
- **sortable attributes**: posted_at, salary_min, salary_max.

Remote reach is filtered through the enrichment's `regions` field directly (the
dot path `enrichment.regions`), the same way other enrichment facets are
filtered; there SHALL be no separate derived reach field on the document.

Facets derived from a job's `enrichment` JSONB SHALL be absent (or empty) on the
document when the job is not yet enriched; an unenriched job SHALL still be
indexed and findable by its text fields.

#### Scenario: A job is represented as one searchable document

- **WHEN** a job with title "Senior Go Developer", company "Acme", and a
  description is indexed
- **THEN** the `jobs` index holds one document keyed by that job's `id` whose
  searchable text includes the title, company, and description

#### Scenario: Unenriched job is still indexed

- **WHEN** a job with no enrichment is indexed
- **THEN** the document is present and matchable by its title/company/description
  text, with its enrichment-derived facets absent or empty

#### Scenario: Reach is filterable via the regions facet

- **WHEN** a job with `work_mode=remote` and `regions=[eu]` is indexed
- **THEN** it is returned by a filter on `enrichment.regions = "eu"`

### Requirement: Public job search endpoint

The system SHALL expose `GET /api/v1/jobs/search` as a public (unauthenticated)
endpoint. It SHALL accept a free-text query `q`, facet filters matching the
index's filterable attributes, an optional sort, an optional semantic ratio, and
`limit`/`offset` pagination. Facet filters SHALL include `regions` (the reach
facet) and SHALL NOT include the removed raw `remote` filter. The response SHALL
use the standard list envelope `{"data": [...], "meta": {...}}`, where `data` is
the matched job documents and `meta` carries at least the estimated total hit
count and the applied `limit`/`offset`. The existing `GET /api/v1/jobs` list
endpoint SHALL be unchanged.

Each result SHALL identify its job by `public_slug` and SHALL NOT include the
internal numeric `id`, consistent with the public-identity contract used by the
other public job reads.

#### Scenario: Keyword query returns matches

- **WHEN** a client requests `GET /api/v1/jobs/search?q=golang`
- **THEN** the response is `{"data": [...], "meta": {...}}` with jobs matching
  "golang" in `data` and the estimated total and pagination in `meta`

#### Scenario: Faceted filtering by region

- **WHEN** a client requests
  `GET /api/v1/jobs/search?q=engineer&seniority=senior&regions=eu`
- **THEN** only jobs whose facets satisfy seniority=senior AND whose `regions`
  include `eu` are returned

#### Scenario: Empty query browses with filters

- **WHEN** a client requests `GET /api/v1/jobs/search` with filters but no `q`
- **THEN** the filtered jobs are returned ranked by the index defaults

#### Scenario: Pagination is reflected in meta

- **WHEN** a client requests `GET /api/v1/jobs/search?q=go&limit=10&offset=20`
- **THEN** at most 10 documents are returned and `meta` reports the applied
  `limit` 10 and `offset` 20 alongside the estimated total

#### Scenario: Results identify jobs by public slug, not internal id

- **WHEN** a job is returned by `GET /api/v1/jobs/search`
- **THEN** the result carries the job's `public_slug` and omits the internal
  numeric `id`
