# job-search Specification (delta)

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Default ordering is newest-added first

A search request with no query text and no valid `sort` parameter SHALL return
jobs ordered by the source's posting date (`posted_at`), newest first. A request
with query text and no `sort` SHALL keep relevance order. An explicit valid
`sort` parameter SHALL always take precedence. Both `posted_at` and `created_at`
SHALL be sortable attributes of the index and accepted `sort` values. The
DB-backed jobs list keeps its own stable default (`created_at` descending) and is
no longer required to match the search default.

#### Scenario: Browsing without a query shows freshest postings first

- **WHEN** the search endpoint is called with empty `q` and no `sort`
- **THEN** results are ordered `posted_at` descending

#### Scenario: A text query keeps relevance order

- **WHEN** the search endpoint is called with `q=golang` and no `sort`
- **THEN** results are in relevance order (no sort directive)

#### Scenario: Explicit sort wins

- **WHEN** the search endpoint is called with `sort=created_at&order=desc`
- **THEN** results are ordered by `created_at` descending regardless of `q`
