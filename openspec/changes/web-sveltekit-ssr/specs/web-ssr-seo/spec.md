## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Public pages are server-rendered

The frontend SHALL render the public read pages — the jobs list (`/jobs`), job
detail (`/jobs/:slug`), companies list (`/companies`), and company detail
(`/companies/:slug`) — on the server, so the initial HTML response contains the
page's primary content (job titles/descriptions, company info) before any
client JavaScript runs. The page SHALL then hydrate on the client to become
interactive. The data needed for SSR SHALL be fetched server-side against the
backend API, forwarding the incoming request's session cookie so an
authenticated request renders the correct content.

#### Scenario: Job detail content is in the initial HTML

- **WHEN** a crawler or client requests `GET /jobs/:slug` for an existing job
- **THEN** the returned HTML body already contains the job's title, company, and
  description text (not an empty `<div id="app"></div>` shell)

#### Scenario: Listing content is in the initial HTML

- **WHEN** a crawler or client requests `GET /jobs` or `GET /companies`
- **THEN** the returned HTML body already contains the first page of rendered
  rows

#### Scenario: A missing job server-renders an error state

- **WHEN** the backend returns 404 for the requested slug
- **THEN** the server responds with an error page (not a 200 empty shell), and
  the response status reflects that the resource is not found

### Requirement: Per-route document metadata

Each server-rendered page SHALL emit route-specific document `<head>` metadata in
its initial HTML: a descriptive `<title>`, a `<meta name="description">`, a
canonical URL, and Open Graph / Twitter Card tags. The job-detail page's title
and description SHALL derive from the job (e.g. title and company), replacing the
single static `freehire` title used for every URL.

#### Scenario: Job page has a job-specific title and canonical

- **WHEN** `GET /jobs/:slug` is requested for an existing job
- **THEN** the HTML `<head>` contains a `<title>` built from the job's title and
  company, a `<meta name="description">`, a `<link rel="canonical">` to the
  job's canonical URL, and Open Graph tags

#### Scenario: List pages carry their own metadata

- **WHEN** a public list page (`/jobs`, `/companies`) is requested
- **THEN** its `<head>` carries a page-appropriate title, description, and
  canonical URL distinct from the job-detail metadata

### Requirement: JobPosting structured data

The job-detail page SHALL include a `JobPosting` JSON-LD `<script type="application/ld+json">`
block in its server-rendered HTML, populated from the job's public fields
(title, description, hiring organization, location/remote, posting date, and the
application URL), so the posting is eligible for Google Jobs. Company pages
SHALL include `Organization` JSON-LD.

#### Scenario: Job page emits valid JobPosting JSON-LD

- **WHEN** `GET /jobs/:slug` is requested for an existing job
- **THEN** the HTML contains one `application/ld+json` script with `@type`
  `JobPosting` whose `title`, `description`, `hiringOrganization`, and
  `datePosted` reflect the job

#### Scenario: A closed job reflects its status in structured data

- **WHEN** the job carries a `closed_at`
- **THEN** the `JobPosting` data conveys that the posting is no longer accepting
  applications rather than presenting it as open

### Requirement: robots.txt and sitemap

The site SHALL serve a real `GET /robots.txt` (a valid robots file that allows
crawling of public pages and references the sitemap) and a generated
`GET /sitemap.xml` (valid XML enumerating the indexable job and company URLs).
Neither SHALL return the HTML application shell.

#### Scenario: robots.txt is a valid robots file

- **WHEN** `GET /robots.txt` is requested
- **THEN** the response is a `text/plain` robots file (not HTML) that references
  the sitemap URL

#### Scenario: sitemap enumerates public pages

- **WHEN** `GET /sitemap.xml` is requested
- **THEN** the response is valid XML listing job (`/jobs/:slug`) and company
  (`/companies/:slug`) URLs derived from current data
