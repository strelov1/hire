-- name: RecordJobView :one
-- Record (or refresh) a user's view of a job. Idempotent on (user_id, job_id):
-- the first view creates the row, a repeat view touches viewed_at. Returns the
-- row so the caller learns the current applied_at in the same round-trip.
INSERT INTO user_jobs (user_id, job_id)
VALUES ($1, $2)
ON CONFLICT (user_id, job_id) DO UPDATE SET viewed_at = now()
RETURNING *;

-- name: MarkJobApplied :one
-- Mark a job as applied for a user. Idempotent and independent of a prior view:
-- it inserts the row (viewed_at defaults) or updates applied_at in place, and
-- seeds stage='applied' only when the stage is unset (an advanced stage survives
-- a re-apply, via COALESCE).
INSERT INTO user_jobs (user_id, job_id, applied_at, stage)

-- name: SaveJob :one
-- Save (bookmark) a job for a user. Idempotent and independent of a prior view:
-- it inserts the row (viewed_at defaults) or refreshes saved_at in place.

-- name: UnsaveJob :one
-- Clear a job's saved mark without deleting the interaction row, so view and
-- apply history survive unsaving. No interaction row -> pgx.ErrNoRows; the
-- handler treats that as "already not saved", never as a failure.

-- name: TrackJob :one
-- Set an application's stage and/or notes for a user, idempotently. Upserts the
-- (user, job) row (viewed_at defaults). Partial update: a NULL param leaves that
-- column unchanged (COALESCE keeps the existing value), so the caller can set the
-- stage, the notes, or both in one call. Returns the row.

-- the passive history (rows neither saved nor applied). Closed jobs stay
-- listed: a user's history must not shrink when a posting closes.
